# Backend Implementation and Project Structure

This document provides an overview of the backend implementation and the structure of the project. The backend is built using Python and leverages asynchronous programming with `asyncio` and `FastAPI` for handling WebSocket connections and audio processing.

## Overview

The backend is designed to process audio chunks in real-time using a WebSocket connection. It receives audio data from a client, processes it using a `QuoteDetectionService`, and sends detected quotes back to the client via the WebSocket. The system is built to handle multiple clients concurrently using asynchronous programming.

## Key Components

### WebSocket Server
The WebSocket server is implemented using `FastAPI` and handles real-time communication with clients. It receives audio chunks from the client and adds them to a processing queue.

### Audio Queue Processing
### Quote Detection Service

## How It Works
  ### Client Connection: A client connects to the WebSocket server and starts sending audio chunks.

  ### Queue Processing: Audio chunks are added to a queue for processing.

  ### Quote Detection: The QuoteDetectionService analyzes each audio chunk for quotes.

  ### Response: If a quote is detected, the results are sent back to the client via the WebSocket connection.

  ### Termination: The process continues until a None value is received, signaling the end of the stream.

## Future Improvements
  ### Scalability: Implement a distributed task queue (e.g., Celery) to handle large volumes of audio data.

  ### Error Handling: Add robust error handling for WebSocket disconnections and invalid audio formats.

  ### Database Integration: Store detected quotes in a database for historical analysis.

  ### Testing: Expand test coverage to include edge cases and integration tests.
